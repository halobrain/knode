Python accepts single ('), double (") and triple (''' or """) quotes to denote string
literals, as long as the same type of quote starts and ends the string.

The triple quotes can be used to span the string across multiple lines.
For example, all the following are legal

word = 'word'

sentence = "This is a sentence."

paragraph = """This is a paragraph. It is
made up of multiple lines and sentences."""

(Single quotes can also be used in place of double quotes).
quote="'Hi'" #The string literal is 'Hi'
We can also write the same literal as shown below:
quote='\'Hi\''


Note: Single and double quotes have no difference while using as a literal.
