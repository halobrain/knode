Docstring in Python

Docstring is short for documentation string.

It is a string that occurs as the first statement in a module, function, class, or method definition. We must write what a function/class does in the docstring.

Triple quotes are used while writing docstrings. For example:

    """
    
def double(num):
    """Function to double the value"""
    return 2*num

print(double.__doc__)

"""
Docstring is available to us as the attribute __doc__ of the function. Issue the following code in shell once you run the above program.
