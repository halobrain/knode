"""
A while loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a
target statement as long as a given condition is true. Unlike the for loop, there is
no built-in end counter. It is up to the programmer to make sure that the given
condition stops being True at some point, or else the loop will become an infinite
loop.
