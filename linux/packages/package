apt-get

Above command differs distro-by-distro. 
In Debian based Linux distributions, to install, remove and upgrade any package we have Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) package manager.
The apt-get command will help you install the software you need to run in your Linux. 
It is a powerful command-line tool which can perform installation, upgrade, and even removing your software.

In other distributions, such as Fedora, Centos there are different package managers.
