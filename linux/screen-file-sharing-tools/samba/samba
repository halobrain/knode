In computer networking, Server Message Block (SMB), one version of which was also known as 
Common Internet File System (CIFS /sÉªfs/),[1][2] is a network communication protocol for providing shared access to 
files, printers, and serial ports between nodes on a network.

A Samba file server enables file sharing across different operating systems over a network. 
It lets you access your desktop files from a laptop and share files with Windows and macOS users.



To install Samba, we run:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install samba
